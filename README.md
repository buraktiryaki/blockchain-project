# Blockchain Project
This is an assignment given in the parallel computers course. The purpose of the assignment is to calculate the nonce value of the new block in the blockchain.
You can find more information and test results in the report.pdf. The results are calculated on Nvidia Gtx 1050 (on my computer) and Nvidia Tesla k80 (on Azure).
